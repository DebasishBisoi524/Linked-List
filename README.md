# Linked List 📚

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a clean and modular **Java implementation of a singly linked list**. It covers all major linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, removing duplicates, and more.

## 🛠 Features

- Insert at front, end, middle, and specific position
- Delete from front, end, and specific position
- Remove duplicate nodes from sorted list
- Display the list and its length
- Delete the entire list
- Handles edge cases (e.g., empty list, single-node list)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DebasishBisoi524/Linked-List.git
   cd Linked-List
   ```

2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac main/main.java node/Node.java
   java main.Main
   ```

> ⚠️ Make sure Java is installed on your system.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
The Node which is added in the front is: 0
The Node which is added in the end is: 8
The Deleted Node from the front is: 0
...
The Linked List is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> null
The Length of the Linked List is: XX
```
